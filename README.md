## Bamazon
A mock storefront with departments and products. Customers, managers, and supervisors are able to use this app.

## Motivation
A Node app for customers to view items and place orders, for managers to perform inventory control and add new products, and for supervisors to track department profitability and add new departments. 
 
## Demo
Video link coming soon

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Javascript
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)

## Features
- Inquirer provides an easy to use UI with prompts asking the user what they would like to do. 
- Customers may purchase products from the available products in the database. 
- Managers have the ability to add inventory and new products to the databse. 
- Supervisors have the ability to view profit data by department and add new departments. 
- Console table organizes product, inventory, and department data in a concise manner within the CLI. 
- User input validation is present to ensure that customers cannot purchase more inventory than Bamazon has in stock, managers don't add products with no inventory, and supervisors cannot add departments that already exist.

## Installation
- Install [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone the Bamazon repository to your machine
- Open CLI, navigate to the cloned repository, and run the following to install the npm package dependencies 

		npm install

- Open MySQL Workbench, SQL Pro, or your preferred database management app. Open the "bamazon.sql" script from the cloned repo, and run it to set up the database and base product/department data.
- Next, you'll need to update the js files with your password to access your localhost server, assuming your server requires one. You may add it using one of two options.

####Option 1
- Inside the cloned repo, create a pw.js file with the following code, and add you password to that file.

	var pwd = {
		pw: "YOUR PASSWORD HERE"
	}
	
	module.exports = pwd;

####Option 2 
- Remove the requirement for the pw.js file and add your password directly to the bamazonCustomer, bamazonManager, and bamazonSupervisor files.

	// npm requirements
	var inquirer = require("inquirer");
	var mysql = require("mysql");
	var consoleTableNPM = require("console.table");
	// my password for mysql db connection - hidden
	var pw = require("./pw.js"); **<-- REMOVE**

	// create mysql connection
	var connection = mysql.createConnection({
		host: "localhost",
		port: 3306,
		user: "root",
		password: pw.pw, **<- REMOVE, insert your password here in quotes**
		database: "bamazon_db"
	});

- You're ready to go!
